    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>

    <p>Egyptian Fattah (or Fatteh) is a celebratory, layered dish featuring crispy toasted bread, fluffy rice, tender spiced meat (beef or lamb), and a tangy garlic-vinegar tomato sauce, often garnished with fried onions or nuts, symbolizing warmth and generosity, especially during Eid al-Adha and feasts. It's a rich blend of textures and bold flavors, defined by its garlicky broth, spiced sauce, and satisfying layers, distinct from Levantine versions by its lack of yogurt. </p>
